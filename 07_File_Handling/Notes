1. Stram-
Stream is a resource of a device where input/output operations are performed. You can represent a stream as either a destination or asource of characters of indefinite length.


2. Fstream-
Fstream library is another library like iostream library. It provides various classes that help us to interact with files and manipulate them using C++. Following are the three main fstream classes that used most to work with files.
    a. ofstream- It represents an output stream. It's used to creating files and writing informations to these files.
    b. ifstream- It represents an input stream. It's used for reading informations from data files.
    c. fstream- It represents a file stream. it comes with ofstream/ifstream capabilities. That means it's capable of creating files, writing to files, reading from data files.



Working with files generally follows the following orders-

=> Opening a file
Firstly, we need to create an object of any of the file stream classes we want. Then C++ provides open() method to open a file. And following is the syntax to open a file-
    fstream myFile;
    myfile.open("file_name", mode);
Following are the file modes provided by C++-
    ios::in - It opens the file in the reading mode
    ios::out - It opens the file in the writing mode
    ios::app - It opens the file in the append mode. Meaning, the contents that are written to the file are added at the end of the previous content
    ios::ate - It opens the file for the output then read and write control to file's end
    ios::trunc - If a file exist, the file elements should be truncated prior to it's opening.


=> Reading/Writing a file


=> Closing the file
    Whenever we open a file and read/write the content, all the data is flushed into the buffer memory.
    Thus, once we are done working with the file, we need to release the memory to the system. Following is the syntax to close the file-
        myFile.close();
